# Enrollment-System
Course enrollment system project utilizing hash maps, priority queues, lists, and object-oriented programming.

Notes: When first launching the project, do admin mode first in to add courses for students to enroll themselves in. Also, a system is not yet implemented to keep track of which student is logged into the system. Currently, the student that has the chance to enroll and drop from courses is the last registered student.
